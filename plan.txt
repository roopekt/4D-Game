Rendering:
    End result:
        lines in a 4D view frustum, only non-ocluded shown
            color coding based on angle from the slice plane
                fully saturated = on the plane
                white = above
                black = below
        "background" color from rendering of a 3D slice
        some sort of perspective
    Slice rendering:
        vertex shader transforms vertices
        geometry shader:
            takes in 4 vertices (lines_adjacency) representing a tetrahedron
            intersects all edges with the slice plane
            mapps the 3 intersections to 3D space
            outputs the 3 intersections as a triangle
        a standard fragment stage
    Line rendering:
        draw pass:
            hardware line rendering of color & world position
            extra frustum culling done per fragment
            potential problem when an ocluded fragemnt is drawn on top of a non-ocluded fragment
                solutions:
                    1. higher resolution -> multiple pixels per each final pixel
                    2. a point that was erased last frame can only be drawn if the target pixel is empty (erasures must be saved to some buffer)
                    3. each pixel is an array (3D texture & int texture for length) -> multiple slots per pixel  ??How do you parallelize the length??
        erase pass:
            tetrahedrons are rendered
            tetrahedron fragment:
                if a point of a line has been drawn here, do a software oclusion test. Erase if the point is ocluded

Controls:
    Jump and crouch (up is still an axis)
    Walking with QWEASD:
        one forward axis
        two sideways axes
    Rotation:
        4D euler angles: https://www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/csi-viz/members/kageyama/docs/150629_euler_angles_in4d.pdf
        up & down with scroll wheel, clamped
        two angles from the mouse movement
        no rotations that don't change the forward vector
